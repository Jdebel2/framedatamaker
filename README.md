# Frame Data Maker

Frame Data Maker allows you to create fighting game frame data in a JSON format, automating the process of manually inputting data for every frame of an attack. Create hitboxes and hurtboxes with ease, line them up exactly where you want them to be, and export the information to be used in whatever engine you see fit.
